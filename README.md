This was made a few years back and the files uploaded here are only what I have been able to recover to my PC, so there is a very large amount of old code and missing files, meaning that as a whole this CMS will almost certainly not work as a whole without several additions. I have put this file here simply as a means of reference and this should not be downloaded as a complete CMS system.
